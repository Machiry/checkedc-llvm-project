# Summary

CheckCBox is a research project to extend Checked-C
{which itself is an extension of C}  with
static and dynamic checking to detect, prevent
and protect blame-free safe regions {checked-C}
from adversaries and other common programming errors. 

This directory contains LLVM-specific files for 
testing the LLVM implementation of CheckCBox.
The files include build system files and LLVM
test infrastructure configuration files.
